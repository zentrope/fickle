# Work to be done, ideas, etc

## Active


- [ ] Try using an emoji for the button title rather than a template image
- [ ] Revisit using a popup for the window
- [ ] Create a simple NSView derived subclass for the appearance icon, override mouse actions, then constrain it in the thumbnail class
- [ ] Rename ThemeThumbnail to just Thumbnail (simplify names)
- [ ] Use an extension on Bundle to read themes.json and fatal if fails

	   func load<T: Decodable>(from: f String) -> T {
	      ...
	   }

- [ ] Add a context menu for each row (set dark/light pref)

- [ ] On start up, detect image and theme, pre-select in viewer if found
- [ ] Float dismiss control over top of table?
